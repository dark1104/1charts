Traffic Overview
Total traffic volume (bytes/packets)
Top talkers (source/destination IPs)
Top protocols used (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
Traffic trends over time (hourly/daily/weekly)


Flow Metrics
Number of flows per second
Average flow duration
Flow size distribution
Flow direction (inbound vs outbound)


Application & Port Insights
Top applications (based on port/protocol mapping)
Top destination ports
Suspicious or uncommon ports used
Port usage trends


Geolocation Insights
Top countries by traffic volume
Geolocation of source/destination IPs
Traffic heatmap by region


Security & Anomaly Detection
Unusual traffic spikes
Flows with known malicious IPs (via threat intelligence feeds)
Protocol anomalies (e.g., DNS over non-standard ports)
Port scanning or DDoS indicators


Performance Metrics
Latency estimates (if derived from flow timing)
Packet loss indicators (if available)
Jitter (for VoIP flows)


Device & Interface Stats
Top interfaces by traffic
Interface utilization
Device-level flow statistic


Custom Filters & Drilldowns
Traffic by VLAN, subnet, or AS number
User-defined filters (e.g., by IP range, protocol, time window)
Exportable flow records for forensic analysis
